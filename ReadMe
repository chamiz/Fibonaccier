Fibonaccier: Read positive (>0) number n (from stdin or cmdline).
Make 2 asynchronous/concurrent calls to a function fib(...) which
- a) includes a random delay of up to 1 second
- b) calculates and returns the fibonacci number calculated
using the following recursive formula:
   Fib(0) = 0
   Fib(1) = 1
   Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
Wait until both of the asynchronous calls finish.

Print out the resulting Fibonacci number Fib(n), and which one of the two calls finished out first.

FibonacciAsync.py contains the main method for the execution
